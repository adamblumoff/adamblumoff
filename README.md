##About Me

I’m Adam Blumoff, a recent Amherst College Computer Science graduate building products that create meaningful value for users and for myself. My focus is on reducing friction through software that helps people spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time on what matters.

##Current Project: CareBase

CareBase helps caregivers manage everything in one place: appointments, bills, and notes, so they can focus on patients instead of logistics. Caregiving often involves information overload from emails, texts, portals, and calls. CareBase aims to cut through that noise and reduce [caregiver burnout](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9225-caregiver-burnout) by centralizing key information.

##Other Projects

###[Student Success Prediction](https://www.github.com/adamblumoff/student-success-prediction)
A machine learning platform that identifies at-risk K–12 students early, helping educators intervene before students fall behind.

###[Othello Game Engine](https://www.github.com/OthelloEngine)
Developed competitive Othello AI engines using search algorithms like Principled Variable Search and Q-learning. The alpha-beta engine achieved a 90% win rate against a fixed opponent after over 1,000 simulated games. This project focused on comparing a state-of-the-art game-playing algorithm to reinforcement learning techniques, and concluding which is better for Othello. I also co-authored the paper, which is in the repo.  

###[Social Dominance Hierarchy Database](https://www.github.com/adamblumoff/cosc-257_bird_dbms)
Designed a PostgreSQL schema and ETL pipeline in Python to process over 10,000 bird observation records for ecological research. The system calculated dominance scores and analyzed hierarchical patterns across populations, enabling data-driven insights into social structure. My emphasis was placed on clean data modeling, statistical analysis, and research usability. This project was eventually developed into a full-stack application with a frontend and a leaderboard; however, I did not contribute significantly to this specific development. I focused on the ETL pipeline. 

###[Unity Game Development](https://www.github.com/adamblumoff/ZombieShooter) (Final 2D game, Undead Mayhem)
Developed multiple 2D game projects in Unity, focused on player movement, enemy mechanics, and animation systems using C#. Conducted usability testing with peers and refined gameplay based on feedback, increasing user playtime by 50%. Drew on research from Danish and Swedish indie studios to inform design decisions and create immersive player experiences. Also developed an arcade-style first-person basketball game with custom animations and models using Blender. I am currently working on a VR game, but it is on the back burner as I have been developing more traditional apps lately.

##Technologies and Tools

Python, FastAPI, TypeScript, React Native, PostgreSQL, Docker, PyTorch, Unity, C#, Blender, Claude Code, Codex

I enjoy designing clean API architectures, improving full-stack performance, and using AI tools to accelerate development and improve reliability.

##What’s Next

I’m looking for software engineering roles where I can help build fast, reliable, and intelligent products. I’m particularly interested in small, product-driven teams that move quickly and take deep care in engineering quality.
